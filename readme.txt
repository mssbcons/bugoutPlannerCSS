We need you to transform a provided HTML (indexExample.html ) template into readable, well-formated, clean responsive HTML5+CSS3 code, giving teh same 'style and feel' http://www.csszengarden.com/220/ Garments By by Dan Mall. HTML/CSS Code has to be easy to understand / readable and well commented. The result has to be cross-browser compatible, so it must work and look similar on all major browsers. You can use SaSS + Composer or Less, in that case we will need sources and compiled CSS The layout and the menus will be different depending of the screen size, you will need to use bootstrap 3/4 media queries to adapt the layout properly to the browser screen size. We need it to be compatible and look good in older browsers and small screen sizes, our target is between 800px and 1024px width, should adapt gracefully to bigger widths, too.

indexExample.html will not run. It is schematic only.
styleExample.css is the sheet for http://www.csszengarden.com/220/ Garments By by Dan Mall which is the 'look and feel' we require.
